# Potterbot

Potterbot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.



## What it does

Potterbot listens for a few Harry Potter-themed phrases and responds in an accordingly silly way. Try these:

- Oy! Potter!
- wingardium leviosa
- accio (amazed | badass | boss | clap | contempt | crying | dancing)
    (Summons a gif based on one of these keywords)
- secret meeting
    (Lets the user know if Dumbledore's Army is meeting tonight)
- how many Weasleys?
    (Counts the number of times the name "Weasley" has been mentioned)



## Local installation

- Download this repo to your local machine. 
- Navigate to it in your terminal.
    $ cd mybot
- Using your own Slack token, run:
    $ HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=SLACK_TOKEN_HERE ./bin/hubot --adapter slack
- Now open a direct message in Slack with your bot, or invite your bot to a channel, and chat away!
